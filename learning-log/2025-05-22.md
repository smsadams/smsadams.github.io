## Codecademy – Python 3: Lists

### 🧠 What is a List?
- A **list** is an ordered, changeable (mutable) collection of items.
- Lists can contain multiple data types and are written with square brackets `[]`.

Example:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

---

### 🔎 Accessing List Items
- Lists are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element is at index `0`.
- Use **negative indexing** to count from the end.

Examples:
```python
print(fruits[0])   # Outputs: "apple"
print(fruits[-1])  # Outputs: "cherry"
```

---

### 🛠️ Modifying Lists
- You can change items after the list is created.

Examples:
```python
fruits[1] = "mango"           # Change value
fruits.append("orange")       # Add to end
fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")      # Insert at position 1
```

---

### 🧹 Removing Items from a List
- `remove(value)` – Removes first occurrence of a value
- `pop(index)` – Removes and returns item at index (defaults to last)
- `del` – Deletes an item by index

Examples:
```python
fruits.remove("banana")
del fruits[0]
fruits.pop()
```

---

### 📏 Useful List Functions
- `len()` – Number of elements in a list
- `sum()` – Adds numbers in a list (works only with numeric types)
- `min()` / `max()` – Returns smallest/largest item
- `sorted()` – Returns a new sorted list
- `.sort()` – Sorts list in place

Example:
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4]
print(sorted(numbers))  # [1, 3, 4]
```

---

### 🔁 Looping Through Lists
- Use a `for` loop to iterate over list items.

Example:
```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

### ❓ Checking for Membership
- Use the `in` keyword to check if a list contains an item.

Example:
```python
"apple" in fruits  # Returns True or False
```

---

### ✂️ Slicing Lists
- Access a subset of a list using slice syntax.

Examples:
```python
fruits[1:3]    # Items at index 1 and 2
fruits[:2]     # First two items
fruits[::2]    # Every second item
```

---

### 📦 Nested Lists
- Lists can contain other lists – often used for matrices or grids.

Example:
```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
print(matrix[1][0])  # Outputs: 3
```

---

### 🧪 List Comprehensions
- Create a new list using concise syntax and optional conditionals.

Examples:
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]       # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```
