## Codecademy – Python 3: Flow Control

### 🧠 Understanding Boolean Logic
- **Boolean expressions** are logical statements that evaluate to either `True` or `False`. They're essential for decision-making in code.
- A **boolean variable** is a variable that stores either `True` or `False` — no other values.

### 🔧 Relational Operators (Used in Comparisons)
These operators are used to compare values and form Boolean expressions:
- `==` — Equal to  
- `!=` — Not equal to  
- `>` — Greater than  
- `>=` — Greater than or equal to  
- `<` — Less than  
- `<=` — Less than or equal to  

### 🔀 Control Flow with Conditional Statements
Control flow structures determine how and when certain blocks of code execute:
- `if` — Runs a block of code **only if** a condition is `True`.
- `elif` — (short for "else if") Adds additional conditions if the first `if` wasn't `True`.
- `else` — Executes when all previous conditions are `False`.

Example:
```python
temperature = 30
if temperature > 35:
    print("It's very hot outside!")
elif temperature > 20:
    print("It's a nice day.")
else:
    print("It's a bit chilly.")

## TryHackMe – Networking Basics

### 🌐 What is a Network?

* A **network** is a group of two or more devices (computers, phones, printers, etc.) that are connected to share data and resources.
* The **internet** is the world’s largest network — it connects billions of devices globally using a series of interlinked routers and protocols.

### 🌍 Public vs Private Networks

* **Public networks**: Accessible over the open internet; examples include coffee shop Wi-Fi or your ISP’s network.
* **Private networks**: Used within homes or businesses; protected by firewalls and typically hidden from external access.

### 📛 IP Addresses (Internet Protocol)

#### 🧭 What is an IP Address?

* An **IP address** uniquely identifies a device on a network, much like a mailing address for your home.
* Every device connected to a network is assigned an IP address, either dynamically (via DHCP) or statically (manually configured).
* IP addresses are used to send data to the correct destination — like sending a letter to a friend’s home.

#### 📋 IP Address Format (IPv4)

* Format: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` — four numbers called **octets**, each ranging from 0 to 255.
* Example: `192.168.1.100`
* IPv4 has a total of **2³² = \~4.3 billion** possible addresses.

#### 📶 Types of IP Addresses

* **Public IP address**:

  * Used to identify a device on the **internet**.
  * Assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).
  * Only one device (usually your home router) has a public IP, and all internal devices use it via NAT (Network Address Translation).
* **Private IP address**:

  * Used within a **local network** (e.g., home, office).
  * Cannot be accessed directly from the internet.
  * Reserved ranges include:

    * `192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255`
    * `10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255`
    * `172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255`

#### 🌍 IPv6 – The Future of IP Addressing

* IPv6 addresses the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.
* Uses 128-bit addresses: **2¹²⁸ = 340 undecillion** possible addresses.
* Written in hexadecimal and separated by colons, e.g.:

  ```
  2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
  ```
* Features:

  * Larger address space
  * Built-in security (IPSec)
  * Simplified routing

### 🧬 MAC Addresses (Media Access Control)

#### 🔎 What is a MAC Address?

* A **MAC address** is a unique hardware identifier assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC).
* Stands for **Media Access Control** address.
* Format: 6 pairs of hexadecimal characters, often separated by colons or hyphens:

  ```
  00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
  ```
* The **first half** usually identifies the manufacturer; the **second half** is unique to the device.
* MAC addresses operate at the **data link layer** (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

#### 🛠 Can MAC Addresses Be Changed?

* Yes, it’s called **MAC spoofing**.
* While MAC addresses are “burned into” hardware, they can be overridden in software for privacy, testing, or bypassing access controls.

### 🛠️ Useful Network Tool – `ping`

#### 📡 What is Ping?

* `ping` is a command-line tool that checks if one device can reach another across a network.
* Sends an **ICMP Echo Request** and waits for an **Echo Reply**.
* It reports:

  * If the target is reachable
  * How long the response took (latency)
  * Packet loss (if any)

#### 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
ping google.com
```

* A successful result will show response time in milliseconds (ms) and indicate network health.
