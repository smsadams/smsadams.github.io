## ðŸ“š Resources
- [Codecademy Learn Python 3 â€“ Lists & Loops module](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [Codecademy Cheatsheet â€“ Lists & Loops](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-loops/cheatsheet)

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways

### Lists
- **Definition**: Ordered, mutable collections created with square brackets `[]`.
- **Mixed Types**: Can contain strings, numbers, booleans, or even other lists.
  ```python
  sample = ["apple", 3, True]
  ```

- **Indexing & Slicing**:
  ```python
  colours = ["red", "green", "blue"]
  colours[0]      # "red"
  colours[-1]     # "blue"
  colours[:2]     # ["red", "green"]
  ```

- **Adding Items**:
  - `list_a + list_b` â†’ Returns a new combined list.
  - `.append(item)` â†’ Adds one item (modifies list).
  - `.extend(iterable)` â†’ Adds multiple items at once.

- **Removing Items**:
  - `.remove(value)` â†’ Removes first occurrence.
  - `.pop(index)` â†’ Removes by index (default = last).

- **Nested Lists**:
  ```python
  matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  matrix[1][0]  # 3
  ```

### Loops with Lists
- **For Loop â€“ Direct Iteration**:
  ```python
  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```

- **For Loop â€“ By Index**:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(fruits)):
      print(f"{i}: {fruits[i]}")
  ```

- **List Comprehension**:
  ```python
  cheap = [p for p in prices if p < 30]
  ```

- **Aggregations**:
  ```python
  total = sum(prices)
  average = total / len(prices)
  ```

- **Common Trap**: Modifying a list (e.g., `.append()`) while iterating can cause infinite loops or unexpected behavior.

### Additional Loop Concepts
- **Break Keyword**: Exits a loop immediately when executed, continuing with the first line after the loop.
  ```python
  numbers = [0, 254, 2, -1, 3]
  for num in numbers:
      if num < 0:
          print("Negative number detected!")
          break
      print(num)
  # Output: 
  # 0
  # 254
  # 2
  # Negative number detected!
  ```

- **Continue Keyword**: Skips the remaining code in the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
  ```python
  big_number_list = [1, 2, -1, 4, -5, 5, 2, -9]
  for i in big_number_list:
      if i < 0:
          continue
      print(i)
  # Output: 1, 2, 4, 5, 2
  ```

- **Loops with range()**: Iterates a specific number of times using `range()`.
  ```python
  # Print numbers 0, 1, 2
  for i in range(3):
      print(i)

  # Print "WARNING" 3 times
  for i in range(3):
      print("WARNING")
  ```

- **While Loops**: Executes as long as a condition is `True`. Condition is checked before each iteration.
  ```python
  # Runs once
  hungry = True
  while hungry:
      print("Time to eat!")
      hungry = False

  # Runs 5 times
  i = 1
  while i < 6:
      print(i)
      i = i + 1
  ```

- **Nested Loops**: Loops inside loops, useful for iterating over nested lists.
  ```python
  groups = [["Jobs", "Gates"], ["Newton", "Euclid"], ["Einstein", "Feynman"]]
  for group in groups:
      for name in group:
          print(name)
  # Output: Jobs, Gates, Newton, Euclid, Einstein, Feynman
  ```

- **Infinite Loops**: Loops that never terminate due to incorrect logic or typos. Interrupt with `Ctrl + C`.
  ```python
  # Example of an infinite loop (do not run without termination condition)
  # while True:
  #     print("This will run forever!")
  ```

## ðŸ¤” Challenges & Questions
- Why does altering a list during iteration lead to logic errors?
- When is `range(len(...))` preferable to `zip()`?
- Practice rewriting standard loops as list comprehensions.

## ðŸ¤– Additional Learning
- **+= Operator**: Shorthand for re-assigning a variable to itself plus another value.
  ```python
  total += price  # Same as total = total + price
  ```

- **List Comprehension Template**:
  ```python
  [action for element in iterable if condition]
  ```

- **Filtering Two Parallel Lists by Index**:
  ```python
  cuts_under_30 = [
      hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(new_prices))
      if new_prices[i] < 30
  ]
  ```

## ðŸ’» Mini-Project: Hair Salon Price Tracker
```python
hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks", "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]
prices     = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]
last_week  = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]

# 1. Average price
avg_price = sum(prices) / len(prices)

# 2. Discount prices by $5
new_prices = [p - 5 for p in prices]

# 3. Revenue last week
revenue = 0
for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
    revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]

# 4. Haircuts now under $30
affordable_cuts = [
    hairstyles[i] for i in range(len(new_prices))
    if new_prices[i] < 30
]

print(f"Average haircut price: ${avg_price}")
print(f"Total revenue last week: ${revenue}")
print("Cuts under $30:", affordable_cuts)
```
