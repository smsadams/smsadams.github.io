## 📘 Python – String Methods (Codecademy)

Today I studied Python string methods from the [Codecademy Python 3 Strings Cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3/modules/learn-python3-strings/cheatsheet). Here are the key methods I learned:

- `.lower()` – Converts a string to lowercase.
- `.upper()` – Converts a string to uppercase.
- `.title()` – Capitalises the first letter of each word.
- `.strip()` – Removes leading/trailing whitespace.
- `.split()` – Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.
- `.replace(old, new)` – Replaces substrings with a new string.
- `.find(substring)` – Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
- `.format()` – Inserts variables into strings using placeholders.
- `in` keyword – Checks if a substring exists within another string.

I also practised:
- Replacing strange delimiters in messy data
- Splitting and cleaning up transaction strings
- Counting occurrences using loops and `.count()`
- Using `.format()` vs f-strings for string interpolation

## 📊 Statistics & Probability – Khan Academy

Started the **Statistics and Probability** course on Khan Academy. Covered the following concepts:

- **Bar charts** – Representing data visually using rectangular bars
- **Pictograms** – Visualising data with icons or images (e.g. each icon = 5 people)
- **Venn diagrams** – Showing overlaps between groups
- **Two-way frequency tables** – Organising data from two categorical variables

Key takeaway: Being able to visually interpret and summarise data is just as important as raw calculation.

## 🧮 AP Calculus AB – Limits (Khan Academy)

I also began working through the **AP College Calculus AB** course, focusing on:

- **Introduction to Limits** – Understanding what a function approaches as input approaches a value
- Concepts of continuity and how limits relate to function behaviour
- Notation: `lim x→a f(x)` and understanding limit existence

Although still early days, I’m getting a feel for how limits form the foundation for derivatives and integration.
